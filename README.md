# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I make tools in spare time.

If one of my repo doesn't have license, it means that you are free to use it in any way you want, but:
- derivative works can't mention me
- you are using this code at your own risk 
- I dont give any warranty that this code works XD, it's basically my free work

## Current projects

Currently Im working on:
- [tool](https://github.com/Ziemniakoss/sfdx-cpq-scripts-deployment) for cpq scripts management
- treesitter grammar for apex
- minimal apex pmd validator pipe for bitbucket (and maybe later for gh)
